# Rypto
Rypto is a powerful and efficient cryptojacking detection tool built using the Rust programming language. Its primary goal is to detect and prevent unauthorized cryptojacking activities, where malicious actors hijack computing resources to mine cryptocurrencies without consent.

## Planned features:

* **Network Traffic Analysis**: Rypto analyzes network traffic, capturing and inspecting packets to identify suspicious activities related to cryptojacking. It examines HTTP requests, TCP packets, and known cryptojacking signatures, enabling early detection of malicious mining attempts.

* **CPU Usage Monitoring**: The tool monitors system resource utilization, with a specific focus on CPU usage. By constantly monitoring the CPU load, Rypto can detect significant spikes in resource consumption, a common indicator of cryptojacking activity.

* **Browser Behavior Analysis**: Rypto employs browser behavior analysis techniques to identify cryptojacking scripts embedded in websites. By leveraging Rust libraries with browser automation capabilities, it inspects browser activities for any signs of unauthorized cryptocurrency mining.

* **Intelligent Detection Algorithms**: Powered by sophisticated detection algorithms, Rypto uses a combination of heuristics, machine learning techniques, and rule-based approaches to identify patterns and indicators of cryptojacking activities. It continuously evolves to adapt to new techniques employed by cryptojackers.

* **Real-time Alerts and Reporting**: When cryptojacking activities are detected, Rypto generates real-time alerts and notifications. System administrators receive immediate warnings, enabling them to take prompt action against the unauthorized mining activities. Detailed reports provide insights into the detected threats, aiding in analysis and mitigation.

* **Lightweight and Performance-focused**: Rypto is designed with a focus on performance and efficiency. Leveraging the Rust programming language's benefits, it ensures minimal resource consumption while delivering reliable and accurate detection results.
